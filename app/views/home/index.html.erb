Welcome to my first page created in <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_rails'>Ruby on Rails</a>!
This small site is made up of about 90 files but it's now much more scalable and organized and flexible than
<a href='http://www.flashbit.com'>my site running on Tomcat</a>. The Model-view-controller pattern that is used
by Ruby on Rails keeps
the styling and data and layout separate from each other. Everything has a clear place so nothing feels cluttered.
The logic of the layout looks clean and clear since it isn't mixed in with styling and data. This is known
as <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns'>separation of concerns</a> which makes the site
much easier to understand and manipulate.  <br>
Since I'm using the <a href='http://d3js.org/'>D3</a> JavaScript data visualization library for my data visualizations,
there is some JavaScript in the site in addition to the Ruby. The version of Ruby on Rails that I'm using
ships with a JavaScript library called CoffeeScript which makes JavaScript cleaner and sleeker and further
organizes my code for the site. <br>
For the above visualization of <a href='http://www.google.org/flutrends/us/#US'>Google Flu Trends</a> I'd like to
add grid lines to show the years, to better show the time of year that the flu peaks. A useful addition
to the visualization to help in understanding would be a vertical line that appears when you click or
hover over it; the line could show the height for that region on that date. Visualization is so
powerful; it would be so much easier to show you than to explain it. The height of the line would be representative
of the number of flu like illness occurrences on that date in that region.  Finally, I'd like to make an adjustment
to the stream graph calculations so that it's more centered. That might make a good contribution to the D3 codebase.
Although it isn't very obvious here, with some data sets stream graphs get very off center. But before
I do any of those things, I want to add some new time visualizations. I'd like to add a time line that allows
zooming. I have a flu text data set that contains some interesting history of flu in the United States. I'd like to
create a time line visualization of that.
